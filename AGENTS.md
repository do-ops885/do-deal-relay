# AGENTS.md

> Single source of truth for all AI coding agents in this repository.
> Supported by: Claude Code, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Codex, Copilot, OpenCode, Devin, Amp, Zed, Warp, RooCode, Jules or reference with @AGENTS.md in cli .md
> See the open spec: https://agents.md

## Project Overview

Production-ready template for AI agent-powered development with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and more.
Primary stack: Bash scripts, Markdown documentation, GitHub Actions CI/CD.

## Setup

```bash
# Create skill symlinks after cloning (single source: .agents/skills/)
./scripts/setup-skills.sh

# Install git pre-commit hook
cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Run Tests

```bash
# Run quality gate (run before every commit)
./scripts/quality_gate.sh
```

Always run the full quality gate before committing. Fix all errors before finishing a task.

## Code Style

- **Max 500 lines per source file** - split into focused sub-modules if exceeded
- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `refactor:`
- All public APIs must be documented
- No hardcoded magic numbers - use named constants or config
- Render architecture diagrams as fenced ```mermaid``` blocks, never raw ASCII art
- Shell scripts: Use `shellcheck` for linting, `bats` for testing
- Markdown: Use `markdownlint` for consistency

## Testing Instructions

- Write or update tests for every code change, even if not explicitly requested
- Tests must be deterministic - use seeded RNG where randomness is needed
- Success is silent; only surface failures (context-efficient back-pressure)
- See `agents-docs/CONTEXT.md` for back-pressure patterns

## PR Instructions

- Title format: `[type(scope)] short description`
- Always run lint and tests before committing
- Create a new branch per feature/fix - never commit directly to `main`
- Keep PRs focused; one concern per PR

## Security

- Never commit secrets or API keys - use environment variables or `.env` (gitignored)
- Never connect to untrusted MCP servers - tool descriptions inject into the system prompt
- Report vulnerabilities via GitHub private advisories

## Agent Guidance

### Plan Before Executing
For non-trivial tasks: produce a written plan first, pause, and wait for confirmation
before writing code.

### Skills: Single Source in .agents/skills/
All skills live canonically in `.agents/skills/`. Claude Code and Gemini CLI use
symlinks pointing back to `.agents/skills/`. OpenCode reads skills directly from
`.agents/skills/` - no symlinks needed. Run `./scripts/setup-skills.sh` after
cloning to create symlinks for Claude Code and Gemini CLI. See `agents-docs/SKILLS.md`.

### Context Discipline
- Delegate isolated research and analysis to sub-agents
- Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks
- Load skills only when needed, not upfront

### Nested AGENTS.md
For monorepos, place an additional `AGENTS.md` inside each sub-package.
The agent reads the nearest file in the directory tree - closest one takes precedence.
