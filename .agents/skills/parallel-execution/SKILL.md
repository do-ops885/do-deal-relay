# Parallel Execution

Execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously to maximize throughput and minimize total execution time.

## When to Use

- Multiple independent tasks (no dependencies)
- Tasks benefit from concurrent execution
- Available agents for parallel work
- Results can be aggregated after completion

## Core Concepts

### Independence

Tasks are independent when:

- ✓ No data dependencies
- ✓ No resource conflicts
- ✓ No ordering requirements
- ✓ Failures are isolated

### Concurrency

**Critical**: Use **single message** with **multiple Task tool calls**

```
Single message:
- Task → Agent A
- Task → Agent B
- Task → Agent C

All start simultaneously.
```

### Synchronization

- Wait for all agents to complete
- Collect and validate results
- Aggregate into final output

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Independent Tasks

Checklist:

- [ ] No data dependencies
- [ ] No shared writes
- [ ] No execution order requirements
- [ ] Failures don't cascade

### Step 2: Agent Assignment

Available: code-reviewer, test-runner, feature-implementer, refactorer, debugger

### Step 3: Launch Parallel Execution

Single message with multiple Task tool calls. All agents start simultaneously.

### Step 4: Monitor Execution

- Track progress every 2-3 minutes
- Note completion times
- Watch for errors

### Step 5: Collect & Validate

As each completes:

1. Collect output
2. Validate against criteria
3. Mark complete/failed

### Step 6: Aggregate Results

```markdown
## Results

1. ✓ Task A - Result
2. ✓ Task B - Result
3. ✓ Task C - Result

Status: ✓ Success
```

## Execution Patterns

### Homogeneous Parallel

Same agent type, different inputs:

```
├─ test-runner: Test module A
├─ test-runner: Test module B
└─ test-runner: Test module C
```

### Heterogeneous Parallel

Different agent types:

```
├─ code-reviewer: Quality analysis
├─ test-runner: Test execution
└─ debugger: Performance profiling
```

### Parallel with Convergence

Parallel execution → Single synthesis:

```
Phase 1: Parallel investigation
Phase 2: Synthesize findings
```

## Synchronization Strategies

- **Wait for All (AND)**: All must complete
- **Wait for Any (OR)**: First success proceeds
- **Wait for Threshold**: N of M must complete

## Error Handling

### Independent Failures

One failing doesn't stop others:

```
├─ Agent A: ✓ Success
├─ Agent B: ✗ Failed
└─ Agent C: ✓ Success

Collect A and C, report B failed
```

### Strategies

1. **Fail Fast**: Stop if any fails
2. **Best Effort**: Collect successes
3. **Retry Failed**: Retry failures

## Performance

### Speedup Calculation

```
Sequential = T1 + T2 + T3
Parallel = max(T1, T2, T3)
Speedup = Sequential / Parallel
```

Example: Tasks 10min, 15min, 8min

- Sequential: 33 min
- Parallel: 15 min (max)
- Speedup: 2.2x

## Best Practices

### DO:

✓ Verify independence first
✓ Use single message with multiple tools
✓ Balance workload
✓ Handle failures gracefully
✓ Validate each result

### DON'T:

✗ Parallelize dependent tasks
✗ Send sequential messages
✗ Overload single agent
✗ Skip validation

## Examples

### Simple Parallel Review

```
├─ code-reviewer: Review code
└─ test-runner: Run tests
Speedup: 2x
```

### Multi-Module Testing

```
├─ test-runner: Test module A
├─ test-runner: Test module B
└─ test-runner: Test module C
Speedup: 3x
```

### Quality Check

```
├─ code-reviewer: Quality
├─ test-runner: Tests
├─ test-runner: Benchmarks
└─ debugger: Memory check
Speedup: 4x
```

## Integration

Used by **agent-coordination** for independent task strategy.

## Summary

Parallel execution maximizes efficiency through concurrent execution, independent validation, and synchronized aggregation.
