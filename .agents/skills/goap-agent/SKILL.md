# GOAP Agent Skill: Goal-Oriented Action Planning

Enable intelligent planning and execution of complex multi-step tasks through systematic decomposition, dependency mapping, and coordinated multi-agent execution.

Always use the plans/ folder for all files.

## Quick Reference

- **[Execution Strategies](execution-strategies.md)** - Detailed guide on execution patterns
- **[Reference Guide](reference/guide.md)** - Complete examples, templates, and advanced topics

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when facing:

- **Complex Multi-Step Tasks**: Tasks requiring 5+ distinct steps
- **Cross-Domain Problems**: Issues spanning multiple areas
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Tasks benefiting from parallel execution
- **Quality-Critical Work**: Projects requiring validation checkpoints

## Core GOAP Methodology

### The GOAP Planning Cycle

```
1. ANALYZE → 2. DECOMPOSE → 3. STRATEGIZE → 4. COORDINATE → 5. EXECUTE → 6. SYNTHESIZE
```

## Phase 1: Task Analysis

```markdown
## Task Analysis

**Primary Goal**: [Clear statement of what success looks like]
**Constraints**: [Time, Resources]
**Complexity**: Simple/Medium/Complex
```

Context: Use Explore agent, check past patterns, identify available agents.

## Phase 2: Task Decomposition

Use **task-decomposition** skill:

```markdown
### Sub-Goals

1. [Component 1] - Priority: P0, Deps: none
2. [Component 2] - Priority: P1, Deps: Component 1
```

Principles: Atomic, Testable, Independent, Assigned

## Phase 3: Strategy Selection

| Strategy   | When               | Speed |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| Parallel   | Independent tasks  | Nx    |
| Sequential | Dependent tasks    | 1x    |
| Swarm      | Many similar tasks | ~Nx   |
| Hybrid     | Mixed requirements | 2-4x  |

See **[execution-strategies.md](execution-strategies.md)** for details.

## Phase 4: Agent Assignment

| Agent               | Best For          |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| feature-implementer | New functionality |
| debugger            | Bug fixes         |
| test-runner         | Test validation   |
| refactorer          | Code improvements |
| code-reviewer       | Quality assurance |

## Phase 5: Execution Planning

```markdown
## Execution Plan

- Strategy: [Type]
- Quality Gates: [N checkpoints]

### Phase 1

- Tasks: [List]
- Quality Gate: [Criteria]
```

## Phase 6: Coordinated Execution

**Parallel**: Single message, multiple Task tool calls
**Sequential**: Phases with quality gates between
**Monitor**: Track progress, validate results

## Phase 7: Result Synthesis

```markdown
## Summary

✓ Completed: [Tasks]
📦 Deliverables: [List]
✅ Quality: [Status]
```

## Common Patterns

- **Research → Implement → Validate**
- **Investigate → Diagnose → Fix → Verify**
- **Audit → Improve → Validate**

## Error Handling

- **Agent Failure**: Retry, Reassign, Modify, or Escalate
- **Quality Gate Failure**: Re-run with fixes
- **Blocked**: Re-order or work on independent tasks

## Best Practices

### DO:

✓ Break tasks into atomic units
✓ Define clear quality gates
✓ Match agents to requirements
✓ Monitor and validate incrementally

### DON'T:

✗ Create monolithic tasks
✗ Skip quality gates
✗ Assume independence without verification

## Integration

- **task-decomposition**: Phase 2
- **parallel-execution**: Strategy implementation

## Summary

GOAP enables systematic planning through: Analysis, Decomposition, Strategy, Quality Assurance, and Coordinated Agents.
