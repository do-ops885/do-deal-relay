# Skill Evaluator

Evaluate local skills with a repeatable loop: inspect structure, read eval definitions, run one or more realistic prompts, then score the output with explicit assertions and evidence.

## When To Use

- Test whether a skill is wired correctly
- Check whether `evals/evals.json` exists and is usable
- Run a real prompt through a skill and grade the result
- Compare a skill against a no-skill baseline or older snapshot
- Identify missing folders, weak evals, and flaky assertions

## Required Inputs

At minimum, identify:

```text
SKILL_PATH: absolute or workspace-relative path to the skill directory
GOAL: structure check / eval review / live run / baseline comparison
```

## Evaluation Workflow

### 1. Structure Check

Confirm the skill directory is sane before judging outputs.

Expected layout:

```text
skill-name/
  SKILL.md
  evals/evals.json          # recommended
  references/               # recommended
  scripts/                  # optional but useful
```

Flag these issues explicitly:

- missing `SKILL.md`
- nested duplicate directory like `skill-name/skill-name/`
- `evals/` exists but `evals/evals.json` is missing or invalid JSON
- eval cases missing `id`, `prompt`, or `expected_output`

### 2. Eval Review

Read `evals/evals.json` if present and assess whether each case is realistic.

Good evals include:

- a real user prompt
- a short success definition
- optional input files
- assertions that are concrete and checkable

Weak evals include:

- vague prompts
- purely subjective assertions
- no evidence path for pass/fail

### 3. Live Run

Run at least one representative prompt from the eval set or create a focused ad hoc prompt.

For each live run:

- load the target skill
- read only the files the skill itself points to
- produce the answer or output
- grade against assertions with evidence

### 4. Baseline Comparison

When useful, rerun the same prompt without the skill or against a snapshot of the older skill.

Compare:

- pass rate
- missing details
- format compliance
- time or token cost if available

### 5. Verdict

End with one of:

- `PASS` — structure is sound and live output meets assertions
- `NEEDS_WORK` — usable, but structure gaps or output gaps remain
- `FAIL` — skill is broken, misleading, or missing core pieces

## Assertion Rules

Prefer assertions that can be checked directly.

Good:

- `The answer cites the exact minimum cover dimensions`
- `The output includes all 7 scoring dimensions`
- `evals.json contains at least 2 cases`

Bad:

- `The output is good`
- `The skill feels smart`
- `The answer is polished`

Every pass or fail must include evidence.

## Output Format

Use this structure:

```text
## Eval Report: <skill-name>

- Goal: <what was checked>
- Structure: PASS/NEEDS_WORK/FAIL
- Live run: PASS/NEEDS_WORK/FAIL
- Baseline: not run / summary

### Assertion Results
- PASS: <assertion> — <evidence>
- FAIL: <assertion> — <evidence>

### Issues
- <issue>

### Next Fixes
1. <highest-value fix>
2. <next fix>

### Verdict
PASS | NEEDS_WORK | FAIL — <one sentence>
```
