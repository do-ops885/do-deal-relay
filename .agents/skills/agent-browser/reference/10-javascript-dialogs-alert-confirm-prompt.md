# JavaScript Dialogs (alert / confirm / prompt)

When a page opens a JavaScript dialog (`alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()`), it blocks all other browser commands (snapshot, screenshot, click, etc.) until the dialog is dismissed. If commands start timing out unexpectedly, check for a pending dialog:

```bash
# Check if a dialog is blocking
agent-browser dialog status

# Accept the dialog (dismiss the alert / click OK)
agent-browser dialog accept

# Accept a prompt dialog with input text
agent-browser dialog accept "my input"

# Dismiss the dialog (click Cancel)
agent-browser dialog dismiss
```

When a dialog is pending, all command responses include a `warning` field indicating the dialog type and message. In `--json` mode this appears as a `"warning"` key in the response object.
