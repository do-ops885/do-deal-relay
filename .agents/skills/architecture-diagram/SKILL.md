# Architecture Diagram

Generates an architecture SVG diagram by scanning the live project structure.

## When to run

- User asks to update / regenerate / sync the architecture diagram
- Skills, agents, or commands have changed
- First-time setup (diagram doesn't exist yet)

## Execution

### Step 1 — locate project root

Use the bash tool to find the project root (directory containing `.agents/`):

```bash
# From wherever the agent is currently working
pwd
ls .agents/ .opencode/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

If `.agents/` is not in the current directory, search upward or ask the user
to confirm the project root before continuing.

### Step 2 — run the generator script

Copy the script from the skill bundle into a temp location and run it from
the project root:

```bash
python /path/to/skill/scripts/generate_diagram.py \
  --root . \
  --out docs/architecture.svg
```

The script auto-discovers:
- Skills  → `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` (reads `name:` from frontmatter)
- Agents  → `.opencode/agents/*.md`    (uses filename stem)
- Commands → `.opencode/commands/*.md` (uses filename stem, strips leading `/`)

It writes a self-contained SVG to `--out` (default: `docs/architecture.svg`).

### Step 3 — confirm and report

After the script exits:
1. Tell the user the output path
2. Report counts: N skills · M agents · K commands
3. If counts differ from the last known state, summarise what changed

## Output

`docs/architecture.svg` — a standalone SVG, viewBox 680 × auto, compatible
with GitHub README embedding (`![Architecture](docs/architecture.svg)`).

## Customisation

The script reads an optional `docs/diagram-config.json` if present:

```json
{
  "title": "Project Architecture",
  "project_name": "My Project",
  "author": "maintainer",
  "pipeline_stages": [
    {"name": "build", "color": "teal"},
    {"name": "test", "color": "blue"},
    {"name": "deploy", "color": "green"}
  ]
}
```

All fields are optional — the script uses sensible defaults when the file is
absent.

## Bundled Scripts
