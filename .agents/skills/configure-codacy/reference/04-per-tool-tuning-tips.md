# Per-tool tuning tips

## Semgrep

Semgrep ships patterns for 30+ languages. After init, many patterns will be for languages not in the project. In Step 4, **disable patterns for languages not found by `discover`** — this is usually the single biggest noise reduction. Cross-reference the pattern ID prefix (e.g., `python.`, `javascript.`, `java.`) against the discovered languages.

## Lizard (complexity)

Lizard has rules for cyclomatic complexity (CCN), lines of code (NLOC), and parameter count, each at three severity levels (Critical, Medium, Minor) with configurable `threshold` parameters.

For **established/mature codebases**, the default Medium thresholds produce hundreds of hits on legacy code. Options:

- Disable Medium-level rules and keep only Critical
- Or raise Medium thresholds to match the project's actual complexity profile (better — preserves visibility)

For **greenfield projects**, the default thresholds are reasonable.

## ESLint9

ESLint loads the project's own config file (e.g., `eslint.config.js`), which may import packages. If the project has an existing ESLint config, the `--install-dependencies` flag in Step 3 should handle this. If ESLint still fails with `InvocationError`, the project may need `npm install` or equivalent before analysis.

If the project has a pre-existing ESLint configuration and the user wants to keep it, set `useLocalConfigurationFile: true` on the ESLint9 tool entry instead of using Codacy's managed patterns.

## markdownlint

Rules like MD034 (bare URLs), MD024 (duplicate headings), MD010 (hard tabs), MD004 (list style), MD033 (inline HTML), and MD036 (emphasis as heading) fire heavily on CHANGELOGs and auto-generated docs. These are stylistic, not bugs. Prefer excluding the noisy files (via per-tool `exclude`) over disabling the rules entirely.

## Stylelint

Review results in context — some CSS rules that look like violations may be intentional (e.g., apps that override third-party styles often need `!important` and qualified selectors). When the project has a pre-existing Stylelint config, consider using `useLocalConfigurationFile: true`.
