# Web Search Research - Reference Guide

Comprehensive guide for systematic web research with strategic searches, content analysis, and synthesized findings.

## Date Context Awareness

**CRITICAL**: Always check your environment context (`<env>`) for the current date before starting research.

**Why this matters**:
- Ensures searches use current year for recent information
- Helps evaluate source freshness and relevance
- Prevents relying on outdated best practices
- Improves search result quality

**How to use**:
1. Check `<env>` tag for "Today's date: YYYY-MM-DD"
2. Extract current year (e.g., 2025)
3. Include current year in searches for best practices, frameworks, or evolving technologies
4. Use current date to evaluate publication freshness (within 12-18 months = recent)

## Core Responsibilities - Deep Dive

### 1. Analyze the Query

Break down the user's request to identify:
- Key search terms and concepts
- Types of sources likely to have answers (documentation, blogs, forums, academic papers)

## Search Efficiency - Progressive Strategy

### Round 1: Oriented Search (5 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand the landscape

**Actions**:
- Run 1-2 broad searches
- Quickly scan result titles and snippets
- Identify: Is this well-documented? Common? Novel?

**Decision Point**:
- If official docs found → Fetch and possibly stop
- Otherwise → Continue to Round 2

**Example**:
```
Search: "Rust async best practices"
Results: Scan for official Rust blog, well-known experts
Decision: Found official async book → Fetch, may stop
```

### Round 2: Targeted Search (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Find authoritative sources

**Actions**:
- Run 2-3 specific searches with refined terms
- Use site-specific searches for known authorities
- Fetch 2-3 most promising sources

**Decision Point**:
- If sufficient consensus → Synthesize and stop
- Otherwise → Continue to Round 3

**Example**:
```
Search 1: site:docs.rust-lang.org async
Search 2: "tokio" best practices 2026
Search 3: site:blog.rust-lang.org async patterns
Decision: Found 3 sources with consensus → Synthesize
```

### Round 3: Deep Dive (15 minutes)

**Goal**: Fill gaps and resolve conflicts

**Actions**:
- Search for specific missing information
- Look for alternative perspectives
- Find production examples or case studies
- Fetch 2-4 additional sources

**Decision Point**:
- Synthesize findings regardless of gaps
- Note limitations clearly

**Example**:
```
Search 1: "tokio blocking" production case study
Search 2: async database write patterns GitHub
Search 3: redb async integration issues
Decision: Have enough for synthesis with noted gaps
```

### Round 4: Extended Research (optional, 20+ minutes)

**Goal**: Only for critical decisions or persistent gaps

**Actions**:
- Search academic sources, security advisories
- Look for expert interviews or conference presentations
- Find comparative analyses

**Requirement**: Must justify why Rounds 1-3 were insufficient

**Example Use Cases**:
- Architecture decisions with long-term impact
- Security-sensitive choices
- Novel problem domains with limited information

**Efficiency Tip**: Most research should complete in Round 2. Only 20% of tasks justify Round 3, and <5% justify Round 4.

Key Concepts:
- [Concept 1]
- [Concept 2]
- [Concept 3]

Search Variations:
1. [Broad search] - Understand landscape
2. [Specific technical search] - Find technical details
3. [Site-specific search] - Target authoritative sources
```

### Step 2: Execute Searches

- Run 2-3 initial searches
- Review search results for promising sources
- Identify authoritative and relevant URLs
- Apply triage (Priority 1/2/3/Red Flag)

### Step 3: Fetch Content

- Use WebFetch on 3-5 most promising URLs
- Extract relevant information
- Note publication dates and context
- Save source metadata (URL, title, date, author)

### Step 4: Synthesize

- Organize findings by theme/topic
- Identify consensus and conflicts
- Structure using output format template
- Note any gaps or limitations

### Step 4.5: Evaluate Stopping Criteria

Recognize these signals that you have sufficient information:

#### Positive Indicators (Stop Here) ✅

1. **Consensus Found**: 3+ authoritative sources agree on the approach
2. **Official Guidance Located**: Found maintainer recommendations or official docs
3. **Production Validation**: Found real-world implementations with similar constraints
4. **Actionable Path**: Have clear next steps and implementation guidance
5. **Trade-offs Understood**: Understand pros/cons of main approaches
6. **Time Limit Reached**: Hit your time-box limit with adequate information

#### Warning Signs (Keep Searching) ⚠️

1. **Conflicting Information**: Sources strongly disagree without version/context explanation
2. **Outdated Only**: All sources are >2 years old for fast-moving tech
3. **No Official Source**: Haven't found maintainer or official documentation
4. **Unclear Actionability**: Can't determine specific next steps
5. **Missing Context**: Don't understand why recommendations exist

#### Diminishing Returns (Stop Soon) 📉

- New sources repeat information already found
- Spending >10 minutes without finding new insights
- Found 8+ sources that all say roughly the same thing
- Searches returning increasingly tangential results

**Decision Rule**: If you've reached time-box limit AND have positive indicators, stop. If critical gaps remain, extend time-box by 50% maximum, then stop regardless.
