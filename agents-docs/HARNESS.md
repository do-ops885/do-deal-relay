`coding agent = AI model(s) + harness`

The harness is everything around the model: AGENTS.md, MCP servers, skills, sub-agents,
hooks, and back-pressure mechanisms. Harness engineering is the practice of tuning these
surfaces to improve output quality and reliability.

## Core Principle: Iterate on Failure

Do not design the ideal harness upfront. Add configuration **only when the agent actually
fails**. When a failure occurs, engineer a solution so it cannot happen the same way again.
Throw away what does not help - more config is not always better.

## AGENTS.md Guidelines

- Keep under ~100 lines; human-written (never auto-generated - LLM-generated files hurt quality)
- Concise and universally applicable - every instruction costs tokens
- Use progressive disclosure: detailed docs in `agents-docs/`, not the root file

## Skills (Single Canonical Source)

All skills live in `.agents/skills/`. CLI-specific folders (`.claude/skills/`,
`.opencode/agent/`, `.gemini/skills/`) contain only symlinks.
Run `./scripts/setup-skills.sh` to create them. See `agents-docs/SKILLS.md`.

## MCP Servers

- Only connect servers you actively use and trust
- Tool descriptions inject into the system prompt - each one consumes instruction budget
- Prefer well-known CLIs (GitHub, Docker, databases) over MCP
- Write thin CLI wrappers with concise output rather than verbose MCP responses
- Never connect to untrusted MCP servers - they are a prompt injection vector
